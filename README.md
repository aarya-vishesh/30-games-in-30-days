**The 30 Days Game Development Sprint is a creative challenge where I develop unique and crazy games, focusing on innovative mechanics and ideas.

Each day, I tackle a new concept or refine an existing one, experimenting with quirky twists to make the games fun and unconventional. 

The goal is to push the boundaries of traditional gameplay, delivering small yet optimized projects while testing new ideas. 

From reverse snake mechanics to out-of-the-box Tetris adaptations, every game adds a fresh perspective to the world of indie development. 

This sprint is not just about coding; itâ€™s about unleashing creativity, embracing experimentation, and having fun with game design.**
